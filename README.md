# My dotfiles

User-specific application configuration is traditionally stored in so called [dotfiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dotfile) (files whose filename starts with a dot). It is common practice to track dotfiles with a [version control system](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Version_control_system) such as [Git](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Git) to keep track of changes and synchronize dotfiles across various hosts.
